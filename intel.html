  <pre>
  The Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW)
  (ISO: Anusandhān aur Viślēṣaṇ Viṅg) 
  is the foreign intelligence agency of India.
  It was established in 1968 
  following the intelligence failures 
  of the Sino-Indian War
  which persuaded the Government
  of India to create a specialised
  independent agency dedicated 
  to foreign intelligence gathering
  previously,both domestic and 
  foreign intelligence had been the
  purview of the Intelligence Bureau.

During the nine-year tenure of its first Director, Rameshwar Nath Kao
R&AW quickly came to prominence in the global intelligence community
playing a role in major events such as the accession of the state of
Sikkim to India. The agency's primary function is gathering
foreign intelligence
counter-terrorism, counter-proliferation, advising Indian policymakers
and advancing India's foreign strategic interests. It is also involved
in the security of India's nuclear programme. Many foreign analysts 
consider the R&AW to be an effective organisation and identify it 
as one of the primary instruments of India's national power.</pre>

<h1>INTELLIGENCE BUREAU</h1>
<img src="https://m.jagranjosh.com/imported/images/E/Articles/IB-CHIEF-ARVIND-KUMAR.jpg" width="200" height="200">
<pre>
Shrouded in secrecy, the IB is used to garner intelligence from within India 
and also execute counter-intelligence and counter-terrorism tasks.
The Bureau comprises employees from law enforcement agencies,
mostly from the Indian Police Service (IPS) or the 
Indian Revenue Service (IRS) and the military.
However, the Director of Intelligence Bureau (DIB)
has always been an IPS officer. In addition to
domestic intelligence responsibilities, the IB 
is particularly tasked with intelligence collection
in border areas, following the 1951 recommendations
of the Himmat Singh Ji Committee (also known as the 
North and North-East Border Committee), a task 
entrusted to the military intelligence organisations 
prior to independence in 1947. All spheres of human 
activity within India and in the neighborhood are 
allocated to the charter of duties of the Intelligence Bureau. 
The IB was also tasked with other external intelligence 
responsibilities as of 1951 until 1968, when the Research 
and Analysis Wing was formed.</pre>

<h1>NATIONAL INVESTIGATION AGENCY</h1>

<pre>The National Investigation Agency (NIA) 
is a state agency established by the Indian 
Government to combat terror in India. 
It acts as the Central Counter Terrorism 
Law Enforcement Agency. The agency is 
empowered to deal with terror related 
crimes across states without special 
permission from the states. The Agency 
came into existence with the enactment 
of the National Investigation Agency 
Act 2008 by the Parliament of India 
on 31 December 2008, which was passed 
after the deadly 26/11 terror attack 
in Mumbai. Such an attack clearly 
surfaced the failure of intelligence 
and ability to track such activities 
by existing agencies in India, hence 
the government of India realized the 
need of a specific body to deal with 
terror related activities in India
thereby establishing the NIA. Headquartered 
in New Delhi, the NIA has branches in 
Hyderabad, Guwahati, Kochi, Lucknow, 
Mumbai, Kolkata, Raipur and Jammu.
It maintains NIA Most Wanted list</pre>

<pre>
The Defence Intelligence Agency (D.I.A) 
is an organisation responsible for providing 
and coordinating military intelligence for 
the Indian armed forces.It was created in 
March 2002 and is administered within the 
Ministry of Defence.

DIA is the nodal agency for all defence 
related intelligence, thus distinguishing 
it from the other Indian intelligence 
internal and external agencies. 
DIA controls the Indian armed forces' 
technical intelligence assets
 the Directorate of Signals Intelligence,
a tri-service agency, and the 
Defence Image Processing and Analysis Centre (DIPAC). 
While the Signals Directorate is responsible for 
acquiring and decrypting enemy communications, 
the DIPAC controls India's satellite-based 
image acquisition capabilities</pre>
